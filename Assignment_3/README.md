## Overview
This Android application tracks the orientation of the smartphone in real-time using the built-in accelerometers. It displays the orientation in terms of three axes: X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis. Additionally, the app records the orientation data over time and stores it in a local database. Users can view the history of orientation data through graphical representations of the three axes.
